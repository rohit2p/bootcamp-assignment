SQL Databases
This repository contains two SQL files:

todo.sql: This file creates a database for a simple todo list program.
sales.sql: This file creates a database for a simple sales tracking program.
To use these files, you will need to have a MySQL server installed. Once you have MySQL installed, you can create the databases by running the following commands:

mysql> create database todo;
mysql> use todo;
mysql> source todo.sql;

mysql> create database sales;
mysql> use sales;
mysql> source sales.sql;

Once the databases have been created, you can use them to store your data. For more information on how to use MySQL, please refer to the MySQL documentation.
